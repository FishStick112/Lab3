1&2) The value of the short sum overloads at 256.

3) The value of the long sum overloads at 65536.

4) The value of the float factorial overloads at 35.

5) The value of the double factorial overloads at 171.

6) The expected value should be zero if the summation goes to infinity.

7) An error occurs in the for loop. With float, it appears that is makes
i <= 4.4 rather than what is written (i < 4.4).

8) The double data type corrects this. No longer printing out i = 4.4.
